# Resistive Pulse Particle Sizing Algorithm
## Developed by Christopher McAllister, PhD student in the Zhang Lab (UW Chemistry) 

* Simulates expected resistance values for an array of particle sizes and nanopore cone angles (based on algorithm used in Péter Terejánszky, István Makra, Péter Fürjes, and Róbert E. Gyurcsányi
Analytical Chemistry 2014 86 (10), 4688-4697 DOI: 10.1021/ac500184z)
* takes peak amplitude data from RPS experiments to calculate the size of the particle detected by RPS to be used in volume/concentration determinations
